\subsection{Iterated Local Search}
Iterated Local Search (ILS) is a stochastic local search method that generates a sequence of solutions generated by an embedded heuristic. It can be seen as a family of algorithms based on the same basic procedure:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Generate an initial solution $s$.
    \item Repeat until a stopping criterion is met:
          \begin{enumerate}
              \item Apply a local search procedure to $s$ to obtain a local minimum $s'$.
              \item Perturb $s'$ to obtain a new solution $s$.
              \item Accept $s$ as the new current solution based on some acceptance criterion.
          \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
It's easy to see how ILS is a generalization of algorithms such as VNS where the perturbation changes with the neighbourhood structure and new solution is accepted if it improves upon the current solution.


\subsection{Simulated Annealing}
Simulated Annealing is a optimization algorithm inspired by the annealing process in metallurgy. The algorithm starts with an initial solution and iteratively moves to a new solution. The new solution is accepted if it improves upon the current solution or with a probability that decreases with time. The probability of accepting a solution that is worse than the current solution is given by the Metropolis criterion $p = e^{-(f(x')-f(x))/T}$. The temperature $T$ is a parameter that controls the probability of accepting a worse solution and is decreased over time according to a cooling schedule ($T = \alpha T$).
