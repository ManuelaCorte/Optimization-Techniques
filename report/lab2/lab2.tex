\subsection{Basin Hopping}
The "temperature" parameter for the acceptance or rejection criterion.
Higher "temperatures" mean that larger jumps in function value will be
accepted.  For best results `T` should be comparable to the
separation (in function value) between local minima.

This is a crucial parameter in `basinhopping` and
depends on the problem being solved. The step is chosen uniformly in the
region from x0-stepsize to x0+stepsize, in each dimension. Ideally, it
should be comparable to the typical separation (in argument values) between
local minima of the function being optimized. `basinhopping` will, by
default, adjust `stepsize` to find an optimal value, but this may take
many iterations. You will get quicker results if you set a sensible
initial value for ``stepsize``.
